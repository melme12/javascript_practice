# javascript_practice

This repository is to keep track of the tasks I completed while learning JavaScript.

I am currently working through the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) course 'Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification' and try to solve some problems on [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com), at least sometimes.

PS: Memo to myself, don't forget about [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
